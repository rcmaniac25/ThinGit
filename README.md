Sounds Funny, What is It?
-------

Ever use Thingiverse? MyMiniFactory? Cults3d?

They offer you a way to search through models, find pictures and descriptions, and otherwise easily navigate the many files that are out there.

Then there's that folder on your computer with various zips, sub-folders, and many random STLs. Which was the good benchy STL again?

ThinGit (pronounced "thing, it" or "thing, git" depending on how you want to say it) allows for turning that mess of a folder into an orginized and personal 3D model repository.

Plans

TBD (move to a different file?)

1. Simple, probably CLI model index (STL, 3MF, ZIP, 7z, RAR), make DB so indexing doesn't need to happen often (source data, dest gcode, dates?)
2. Website where you can actually browse the lists of models (images, turn arounds, etc.) [Flutter? Or was that only on mobile]
3. Collections, likes, etc.
4. Assembly (thank you Autodrop3D for the concept) so multi-part models can be handled as one large model
5. Offline browsing (be able to export a collection or whole thing as a HTML archive so people can look at it who aren't running/able to connect to server)
6. Sourcing (where did the model come from) / pull info from source / can I go to another site through this and downloads auto-add them to my collection? (maybe likes and collections can translate through too)
7. Remix/Fork
8. Revisions/branches (like Git) so changes to models can be tracked
9. {redacted} ;)
10. Collabroative modeling?
11. Integrate with other services/systems?

Random:

* Some point support online deployments?
* Scaling?
* API?
* Accounts?
* Requests?
* Don't want to go too crazy with this: initial intent was "how do I show people models I have?"
